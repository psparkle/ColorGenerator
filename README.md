# ColorGenerator
PHP script for generating random, complimentary, and hot-highlight hex values for use in CSS.

I always get bored of the color palettes I make for my site, so I wrote this script to create three colors:
- A dark background color
- A complimentary light color for content / contrast
- A contrasting "hot" color for links / highlights etc.

Having written it, I know it's not the most efficient way to make this happen, and it's not perfect - so builds or suggestions are welcome!
